abstract: >-
  Recent improvements in methods and instruments used in
  mass spectrometry have greatly enhanced the detection of
  protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). On the
  computational side, the adoption of open modification
  search strategies now allows for the identification of a
  wide variety of PTMs, potentially revealing hundreds to
  thousands of distinct modifications in biological samples.
  While the observable part of the proteome is continuously
  growing, the visualization and interpretation of this vast
  amount of data in a comprehensive fashion is not yet
  possible. There is a clear need for methods to easily
  investigate the PTM landscape and to thoroughly examine
  modifications on proteins of interest from acquired mass
  spectrometry data. We present PTMVision, a web server
  providing an intuitive and simple way to interactively
  explore PTMs identified in mass spectrometry-based
  proteomics experiments and to analyze the modification
  sites of proteins within relevant context. It offers a
  variety of tools to visualize the PTM landscape from
  different angles and at different levels, such as 3D
  structures and contact maps, UniMod classification
  summaries, and site specific overviews. The web serverâ€™s
  user-friendly interface ensures accessibility across
  diverse scientific backgrounds.
